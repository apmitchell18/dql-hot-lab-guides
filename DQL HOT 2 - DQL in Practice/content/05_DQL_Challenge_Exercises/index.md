## Hands-On Exercise 5 - Challenge Exercises

In this section, you will find additional exercises to practice and test your abilities querying logs, entities, metrics, and business events in DQL.

## Exercise 1: DQL Entities in Practice

Even though the entity example is very useful, it is not dynamic as we are hardcoding the technology we are looking for into our query. Wouldnâ€™t it be way better to have a refined list of technologies discovered in our environment and select the one we are interested at instead of having to manually hardcode it? 

We can take this example one step further. Using dashboards, some creative queries and variables, we can have the same view with the difference that it can now be dynamically filtered based on the selected discovered technology.

### Step 1: Define a variable to discover technologies
Using a DQL query, look for the detected software technologies based on PGI metadata.

(**Hint**: There are several ways of achieving this. There might be situations where the resulting dataset returns more than 1,000 results which is a limitation for a dashboard variable. Using functions like **collectDistinct** we can make sure we return as many individual meaningful entries as possible.)

```
fetch dt.entity.process_group_instance
| expand softwareTechnologies
| filter isNotNull(softwareTechnologies)
| summarize temp = collectDistinct(softwareTechnologies)
| expand techVersion = temp
| sort techVersion asc
| fieldsRemove temp
```

### Step 2: Adapt the previous example to use the variable 
Using the previous entity information example as a starting point, use the variable to be able to set the technology dynamically based on the value selection.

(**Hint**: [Here](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/observe-and-explore/dashboards-new/components/dashboard-component-data#add-data) you can find the documentation on how to reference variables in your code.

```
fetch dt.entity.process_group_instance
| filter contains(toString(softwareTechnologies), $softwareTechnologies)
| fields entity.name, softwareTechnologies, belongs_to, metadata
| fieldsAdd belongs_string = toString(belongs_to)
| fieldsAdd host = substring(belongs_string, from:indexOf(belongs_string, ":")+2, to:lastIndexOf(belongs_string, "\""))
| lookup [fetch dt.entity.host 
| fields hostName=entity.name, hostId=id ], sourceField:host, lookupField:hostId
| fieldsRemove belongs_to, lookup.hostId, host, belongs_string
| sort entity.name asc
| sort lookup.hostName
```
</details></H4>

### Exercise 2: Logs by management zone
We know that management zones are going away, and because of that there is no built-in way of implementing a filter for management zones. Still, based on what we have seen, having access to both log and entity data and commands like the lookup we should be able to filter (though limited) at management zone level right?

Think about it. We know how to access logs, we know how to filter these log entries, we know how to access entity level data, the only thing we need to do now is to combine all of these concepts into a single dashboard.

### Step 1: Define a variable to discover management zones
In this case, we will reference host level data to retrieve the list of available management zones. In a dashboard, lets define a query type of variable so we can use DQL to access the list of available management zones in the environment.

(**Hint**: Remember using commands like describe to understand what kind of data is avaiable for host entities..)
